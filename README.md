# St.Stephen_Engine
The Lower Level Engine for Our Collaborative Game "The Mountain of Carols."
project: pico-8 engine
by frank bubbico and sam france
date created ~ sept. 2024
release log:
 - v 0.0.1 - basic structure

this engine is being designed for "the mountain of carols," but support for the engine
itself will continue seperate from the project as optimizations and features are introduced.

tabs are meant to read in subsequent order, as each tabs' information will be used later on 
throughout the file. the main goal of this project is to display what we were able to come up with
as solutions to the issues of balancing token(bits of memory) within pico-8. as a result, code may
appear abstract and unintuitive without proper reading order throughout the engine.
 
this engine is mainly meant to provide independent devs/ modders of mountain of carols with an easy 
to use tool kit that they can pick up and use near immediately.
